        <p>Joe Biden has described as a "dangerous precedent" a Supreme Court ruling giving
             former President Donald Trump partial immunity from criminal prosecution.</p>
             <p>The current US president said the judgement undermined the "rule of 
                law" and was "a terrible disservice" to Americans.</p>
             <p>Earlier, Trump hailed the court's decision as a "big win" for democracy. </p>

             <p>The justices found on Monday that a president had immunity
                 for "official acts" but was not immune for
                 "unofficial acts", and referred the matter back to a trial judge.</p>
                 <p>The judgement will further delay the criminal case against Trump for allegedly
                     trying to
                      subvert the 2020 election result that gave victory to Mr Biden. </p>
                      <p>The trial judge must now determine which actions were carried out in Trump's
                         capacity as president, which 
                        could take months. Any trial is unlikely to start before November's presidential
                         election.</p>
